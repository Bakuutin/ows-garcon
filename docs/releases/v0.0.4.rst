What's new in Garcon 0.0.4
==========================

May 12th, 2015
--------------

External Activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SWF allows any activities to be written in any language (allowing the service
to be fully polyglot). This change makes it easier for Garcon to handle and
work with external activities.

To define an external activity: simply set the flag `external` on the activity
creation, and define (it's mandatory) the `timeout` and, if needed, the
`heartbeat` timeout.

Change: `#52 <https://github.com/xethorn/garcon/pull/52/>``
